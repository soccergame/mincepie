"""
Simple Matlab mapper for mincepie.

This is a simple matlab mapper that you can use to deal with some legacy code
that still requires Matlab. It is not very fancy and complex - no Matlab 
engines are required for this, and all you need is the matlab command, as well
as python's subprocess module. 

The downside is that each map() function starts Matlab and closes it, which
causes additional overhead (several seconds, based on your Matlab config).
Thus, it should mostly be used to carry out computation-intensive map tasks
each lasting more than a few seconds. If your map() runs much shorter than
the Matlab start and finish overhead, it's probably not a good idea to
distribute your job, or you need to at least combine multiple small jobs in 
a larger map() call.

Flags defined by this module:
    --singlethread: set matlab to use single thread only.
